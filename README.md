#Class Project - CS4V95.015 Undergraduate Topics in Computer Science
This application is used to play a scavenger hunt game on the UTD campus. A host will create a game and clients can join that game. The host will scan in nfc tagged items that the clients will have to find. The game is over when all items have been found. The winner is the client with the most items collected.
